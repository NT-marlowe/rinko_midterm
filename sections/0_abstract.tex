\section*{Abstract}
In the complex arena of cybersecurity, evasive malware,
such as shadow attacks that obscure malicious activities
through multiple processes, challenge conventional detection methods.
This paper introduces an innovative detection and analysis methodology
using Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to counteract these threats.
eBPF facilitates real-time, in-depth monitoring of system operations,
enabling the identification of sophisticated malware behaviors.

We leverage eBPF to trace process interactions and system calls,
identifying malicious patterns indicative of shadow attacks.
This approach distinguishes between legitimate and malicious activities
by analyzing process executions and network communications.
Despite challenges like data volume and behavior differentiation,
we apply smart filtering and machine learning to enhance detection accuracy.

Our research showcases eBPF's potential in detecting complex malware
through case studies, emphasizing the need for advanced analysis techniques
in cybersecurity.
This work contributes significantly to understanding and mitigating advanced malware threats,
proving eBPF as a vital tool in modern cybersecurity defenses.
