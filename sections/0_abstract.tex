\section*{Abstract}
In the realm of cybersecurity, shadow attacks represent a significant challenge,
as they bypass traditional spec-based detection methods through multi-process obfuscation.
This paper presents a novel method for countering these threats by leveraging
Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) technology to uncover correlations
between shadow processes in real-time.

We propose and discuss a detailed implementation of a system that utilizes
eBPF to swiftly identify interactions between shadow processes,
enabling the detection of shadow attacks with greater efficiency.
Our approach enhances the ability to recognize malicious patterns by examining process executions and system calls, offering a robust method to distinguish between benign and nefarious activities.

While the implementation is still being finalized and experiments have yet to be conducted, our proposed solution demonstrates the potential of eBPF in identifying advanced malware threats. This work contributes significantly to the field of cybersecurity by laying the groundwork for future experiments and analysis to validate this innovative approach.
