\section{Conclusion}
In this paper, we highlighted the existence of shadow attacks,
which pose a significant threat by evading existing specification-based detectors.
To counter these attacks, we proposed a method leveraging eBPF to rapidly detect correlations
between shadow processes and discussed the detailed implementation of this approach.

Moving forward, our primary attention will be directed towards completing
the implementation specifics and carrying out the scheduled experiments to authenticate
our methodology in real-life situations.
